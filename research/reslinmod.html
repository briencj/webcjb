<P>A general strategy is being developed for mixed model analysis that facilitates the analysis of complicated experiments. It involves incorporating an experiment's randomization into the process of specifying the analysis. A detailed description of the approach and its theoretical justification is given in the PhD thesis by Brien (1992), available from the University of Adelaide in a <A HREF="http://thesis.library.adelaide.edu.au/adt-SUA/public/adt-SUA20010530.175833/index.html">a PDF file</A>.  Also a <a href="dammnotes.html">set of notes</a> is available for a subject that I gave in Piracicaba, Brazil, in the first half of 2000 - these notes include the least squares theory underlying the analyses, are based on the application of the approach to agricultural experiments and concentrate on two-tiered experiments.</P>

<P>Current work includes: investigations into the design and structure of multitiered experiments and the computation of their analyses; the formulation of mixed model with separate terms for confounded effects; a detailed study of the method's implications for the design and analysis of grazing trials. A more derailed description of the work is available at the <A HREF="http://chris.brien.name/Multitier/">multitiered experiments site</A>.</P>

<H2>The design and structure of multitiered experiments</H2>

<P>(joint work with Prof. R.A. Bailey, School of Mathematical Sciences, Queen Mary and Westfield College, Mile End Road, London E1 4NS U.K.)</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Multitiered experiments are experiments that involve certain forms of multiple randomizations. They include two-phase, some laboratory, some superimposed and some grazing experiments. Different types of multiple randomization that can occur in multitiered experiments have been identified. The implications of this for the structure on the factors, and hence for the analysis of variance decomposition, are being investigated. In particular, we study the conditions that must be placed on the designs employed to ensure that the analysis remains balanced.</P>

<H2>The computation of the analysis of variance for multitiered experiments</H2>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(joint work with Prof. R.W. Payne, Statistics Department, IACR-Rothamsted, Harpenden AL5 2JQ U.K.)</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">More than one structure formula is required to derive an analysis of variance table that displays the confounding relationships in an experiment and, for nonorthogonal experiments, allows a full analysis. An example for which three structure formulae are required to achieve this has been developed and an algorithm formulated for obtaining the sums of squares for an analysis of this and other experiments requiring three or more formulae. A paper has been published (Brien and Payne, 1999).</P>

<H2>Mixed model analyses with separate sources for confounded effects</H2>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A general strategy for mixed model analysis is being developed that incoporates separate terms in the model for confounded effects. To do this it is essential that the randomization employed in the experiment is taken into account in deriving the model. The approach is outlined in Technical Report No 1996/7 available from the School of Mathematics and Statistics, University of South Australia.</P>

<H2>The design and analysis of grazing trials</H2>

<P>(joint work with Dr. C.G.B. Dem&eacute;trio, Depatmento de Matematica e Estatistica, ESALQ, Universidade de S&atilde;o Paulo, Caixa Postal 9, 13418-900 Piracicaba, SP, Brasil)</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is often difficult to determine the appropriate linear model, and hence analysis of variance, to be used in analysing a grazing trial. This difficulty arises from the need to randomize both pasture treatments and animals to the plots. We have investigated the derivation of the linear models, and associated analyses of variance, to be used in analysing grazing trials so that the randomization that was employed in the experiment is incorporated into the analysis. A paper has been published (Brien and Dem&eacute;trio, 1998) - an <A HREF="grazall.ps"> extended version in a postscript file</A> and  an <A HREF="grazall.pdf">extended version in a PDF file</A> are available.</P>

<H2> Design and ANOVA for experiments involving a field trial and laboratory analyses</H2>

<P>(joint work with B.D. Harch and Dr. R.L. Correll, CSIRO Mathematical &amp; Information Sciences, Adelaide, Australia.)</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Using an experiment to investigate bacterial and fungal diversity in soil samples we examine the design and analysis of two-phase experiments involving a field and a laboratory phase (using Gas Chromatography - Fatty Acid Methyl Ester (GC-FAME) Analysis).  We draw attention to the need to consider randomization of both treatments to field units and field unit to laboratory units.  As such experiments involve at least two randomizations they belong to the class of experiments termed multitiered.  We illustrate how analysis of variance tables that exhibit the confounding in these experiments can be derived, the confounding being the direct result of the randomization employed.  To do this separate terms are included in the analysis of variance table for confounded terms, whereas traditional analysis of variance tables would include only one of any two confounded terms.
