<H1>Team project for <I>The Design & Mixed-Model Analysis of Experiments</I></H1>

<H4>Project objectives</H4>

<UL>
    <LI>give students experience in designing, conducting and analyzing an 
        experiment involving several factors;</LI>
    <LI>provide students with practice in preparing a report on such 
        experiments;</LI>
    <LI>have students become more familiar with working in teams.</LI>
</UL>

<P>For this assignment, you are to work in teams of up to three students.  Each team is to design an experiment to investigate at least 4 factors, where all factors are at 2 levels.  It is suggested that the experiment be to investigate something that at least one of the team has wondered about - an experiment which makes use of some skill that you have is usually the most satisfactory.  To give you an idea of the type of experiment that might be conducted, a <A HREF="dammexpt.html">list of examples</A>, not all of which have enough factors, is available from the web site.  Experiment numbers 1-68 are of the home type -  the others are of the laboratory type.  In choosing an experiment, it is important to ensure that it can be accomplished in the time available (you have just over 3 weeks to come up with the experiment, carry it out and do the analysis) and that you can obtain the resources required.</P>

<H4>Proposal</H4>

<P>Each team is to email me a proposal for the experiment they are going to conduct by 5 pm on Thursday 4th May 2000.  I will return an approval or suggested modifications on Friday 5th May 2000.  The proposal state the objectives of the experiment, which factors are to be investigated and their levels, the design to be used, the order in which the treatments will be investigated, the response variable(s) and how these are to be measured, the procedure for a run or test and the resources required to run the experiment.</P>

<H4>Conducting the experiment and teamwork</H4>

<P>The team must conduct the experiment themselves, analyze the results and write a written report.  In terms of working in teams, it will be necessary for members of the team to decide what each member is going to do and to arrange times to get together to carry out the tasks.</P>

<P>Tasks to be undertaken include:  deciding on the experiment;  designing the experiment;  planning the experiment;  submitting the proposal;  obtaining the material for the experiment;  conducting the experiment, including performing, recording and observing the experiment;  analyzing the experiment;  interpreting the results;  coming up with the conclusions;  writing the report.</P>

<P>Generally, it is not a good idea to assign a task to just one member of the team.  It is usually better to have more than one member assigned to each task, to work cooperatively on it.  Even if one member is given primary responsibility for a task, a better result is likely to be obtained if more than one member is involved in helping to come up with ideas about how to do things, to solve problems, to check what is being done and to generally make helpful suggestions.</P>

<!--H4>Class presentations</H4>

<P>Each team will give a short presentation on their experiment during class time in week 13.  For this you will need to prepare at most three overhead transparencies, summarising (i) the background of your experiment, the question you were aiming to answer and the design employed; (ii) the data you collected, how you analyzed it, and important results of the analysis including results of diagnostic checks; and (iii) any explanation for the results obtained and recommendations for future action and investigations based on the experiments.  Each team member is required to speak about some aspect of the experiment.</P>

<P>You will receive feedback which you can incorporate in the written report if you wish.</P-->

<H4>Written report</H4>

<P>The written report, of 1000-1500 words not including tables, diagrams and appendices, should be arranged as follows:</P>

<P><I>Introduction:</I>  outlining the reasons for doing the experiment that you did and what it was hoped to find.</P>

<P><I>Methods:</I>  containing the name of the design that you chose and how and why you decided on this design;  the procedures used to carry out the experiment; the methods used to analyse the results.</P>

<P><I>Results:</I>  a summary of the results that you obtained from your analysis, including a summary of how the factors affect the response and of the results of any diagnostic checking you performed, and tables and/or plots illustrating the effects of the factors.</P>

<P><I>Conclusions:</I>  the conclusions drawn from the results, including such things as an explanation for the observed results, how one might act in future as far as the topic investigated in the experiment is concerned and what future investigations might be carried out given the results and bearing in mind any difficulties encountered in carrying out the experiment.</P>

<P><I>Appendix:</I>  containing the layout of the experiment, the data collected, the computer output for the analyses and the details of any other computations that had to be done.</P>

<H4>Assessment criteria</H4>

<UL>
    <LI>that you were involved in carrying out the experiment 
        (10% of the 30%)</LI>
    <LI>the merits of the design chosen, the reasons for choosing it and the 
        correctness of the layout used;</LI>
    <LI>the degree to which the analysis performed is complete, correct and 
        appropriate;</LI>
    <LI>the extent to which the interpretation of the results is concise, 
        complete, insightful and correct;</LI>
    <LI>the quality of the presentation of the report.</LI>
</UL>

<H4>Submission of report</H4>

<P>Submit the report to me or to the secretary of Mathematics and Statistics in by <B>5 pm on Friday, 19th May 2000</B>.</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">20% will be deducted for each working day, <BR>
                  or part thereof, that the assignment is submitted late.<BR>
                  The assignment is not redeemable in that it cannot be resubmitted, <BR>
                  or added to, after being handed in.</P>
