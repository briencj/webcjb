\begin{flushleft}\Large\bf A Continuous Grazing Experiment
\end{flushleft}

\nocite{Brien99}Brien and Dem\'{e}trio (1999) discuss the analysis of 
continuous grazing trials based on a randomized complete block design.
The sets for such experiments, when an animal variable is to be analysed, 
are animal, plots and treatments and the tiers
are ${\cal F}_{\rm animals} = \setof{\mbox{Classes}, \mbox{Animals}}$, 
${\cal F}_{\rm plots} = \setof{\mbox{Blocks}, \mbox{Plots}}$ and 
${\cal F}_{\rm treatments} = \setof{\mbox{Treatments}}$.
These experiments involves two randomizations --- treatments to plots and
plots to animals --- and they are composed, as shown in the randomization
diagram in Figure~\ref{fig:sheep}. In spite of this, they are not two-phase 
experiments --- they are single stage.
