\begin{flushleft}\Large\bf Superimposed Experiment using Split Plots
\end{flushleft}

Suppose a randomized complete block experiment with $b$ blocks is set up to
investigate the yield differences between $r$ rootstocks for orange trees
and that each plot in a block consists of $t$ trees.  After several a years
of running this initial experiment, it is decided to incorporate $t$
fertilizer treatments into the experiment by randomizing the $t$ treatments
to the $t$ trees in a plot.

The sets for this experiment are trees, rootstocks and fertilizers and the
tiers are ${\cal F}_{\rm trees} = \setof{\mbox{Blocks}, \mbox{Plots},
\mbox{Trees}}$, ${\cal F}_{\rm rootstocks} = \setof{\mbox{Rootstocks}}$
and ${\cal F}_{\rm fertilizers} = \setof{\mbox{Fertilizers}}$.  There
are two randomizations: rootstocks to plots in the initial experiment and
fertilizers to trees  in the revised
experiment.  The performance of these randomizations being separated in
time, they cannot be achieved in a single randomization.  However, the two
randomizations are independent --- they involve two distinct
 subsets of ${\cal F}_{\rm trees}$: see Figure~\ref{fig:indep}.  
Therefore none of the factors in ${\cal F}_{\rm rootstocks}$ and 
${\cal F}_{\rm fertilizers}$ are associated
by randomization.  
However, these two tiers are not combined because, as a 
result of their separate randomizations, the factors in one tier have
a different status in the randomization to those in the second tier.
%Consequently, we can combine these two tiers into the
%single set ${\cal F}_{\rm treatments} = \setof{\mbox{Rootstocks},
%\mbox{Fertilizers}}$ which we will refer to as and the experiment is 
%essentially two-tiered, in spite of necessarily involving 
%two separate randomizations.
