<h2>Glossary</h2>

<p><B>Note:</B> An exposition of the use of this terminology in the context of an example is available in <a href="MTBibliog.html#Brien17">Brien (2017c, Section 2)</a>.</p>

<p><a name="Aopt"><b>A-optimal design</b> A <A HREF="#expdesign">design</A> for which A-criterion is a minimum over all <A HREF="#expdesign">designs</A> in a specified class of <A HREF="#expdesign">designs</A>, the A-optimal <A HREF="#expdesign">design</A> being a member of the class. The A-criterion is the sum of the reciprocals of the nonzero eigenvalues of the information matrix for the (generalzed) least squares fit of a set of fixed effects. It is equal to the trace of the variance matrix of the estimates of the effects and is inversely proportional to the harmonic mean of nonzero eigenvalues of the information matrix. This latter form is also used as a criterion for selecting an A-optimal design for estimating a set of random effects. Types of A-optimal designs include <A HREF="#ph1condAopt">first-phase-conditionally A-optimal two-phase design</A>, <A HREF="#fixAopt">fixed-model A-optimal design</A>, <A HREF="#mixAopt">mixed-model A-optimal design</A>, <A HREF="#ph2condAopt">second-phase-phase-conditionally A-optimal two-phase design</A></p>

<p><a name="aliasing"><b>aliasing</b></a> Relates to the relationships between <A HREF="#source">sources</A> involving factors from the same <A HREF="#tier">tier</A>; that is, two <A HREF="#source">sources</A> whose factors were both allocated in the same <A HREF="#facalloc">allocation</A> or both recipients in the same <A HREF="#facalloc">allocation</A>. Aliasing between two such <A HREF="#source">sources</A> can arise in two circumstances: (i) considering the two <A HREF="#source">sources</A> in isolation, or (ii) when the two <A HREF="#source">sources</A> are merged or combined with a <A HREF="#source">source</A> involving one of their <A HREF="#recipfactors">recipient factors</A>. There are are three possibilities for the two <A HREF="#source">sources</A>: (i) they are orthogonal so that there is no aliasing and their associated effects can be estimated independently, (ii) one is aliased with the other in that there is no information about one of the <A HREF="#source">sources</A> after the other has been included in the analysis (all of their <A HREF="#ceff">canoncial efficiency factors</A> are equal to one), or (iii) they are partially aliased because there is some information about both <A HREF="#source">sources</A> available (at least some of their <A HREF="#ceff">canoncial efficiency factors</A> are less than one). Technically, this can be viewed as reflecting the relationships between the subspaces of the data space for the <A HREF="#source">sources</A>. For instance, if a factorial experiment involves two treatment factors and the numbers of observations for the combinations are disproprtionate then the main effects of the two factors will be partially aliased. This meaning of aliasing is consistent with the traditional usage of it in the context of fractional 2<SUP><EM>k</EM></SUP> and 3<SUP><EM>k</EM></SUP> factorial designs. (cf. <A HREF="#confound">confounding</A>)</p> 
<!--Technically, the subspace for the allocated <A HREF="#source">source</A> merged with the recipient <A HREF="#source">source</A> is: (i) for orthogonality, orthogonal to the subspaces of all the other merged, allocated <A HREF="#source">sources</A> <A HREF="#confound">confounded</A> with the recipient <A HREF="#source">source</A>,  (ii) for aliased, a subspace of the subspaces of the other merged, allocated <A HREF="#source">sources</A> <A HREF="#confound">confounded</A> with the recipient <A HREF="#source">source</A>, or (iii) for partially aliased, nonorthogonal to the subspaces of all the other merged, allocated <A HREF="#source">sources</A> <A HREF="#confound">confounded</A> with the recipient <A HREF="#source">source</A>. Generally, an aliased <A HREF="#source">source</A> is unable to be estimated from the recipient <A HREF="#source">source</A>.  (cf. <A HREF="#confound">confounding</A>)</p-->

<p><a name="allocfactors"><b>allocated factors/objects</b></a> The set of factors that index the set of <a href="#object">objects</a> that are allocated in an <a href="#facalloc">allocation</a> to a set of <A HREF="#recipfactors">recipient objects and factors</A>. The set of allocated factors will occupy a <A HREF="#panel">panel</A> in the <a href="#object">factor-allocation diagram</a>, so that they form a <a href="#tier">tier</a>, and the <A HREF="#panel">panel</A> is named for the <a href="#object">objects</a>.</p>

<p><a name="ainclusive"><b>allocated-inclusive multiple allocations</b></a> (formerly randomized-inclusive) Involves three <A HREF="#tier">tiers</A> of factors. Tier 3 factors are allocated to tier 2 factors in the first <A HREF="#facalloc">allocation</A>. Then the combined tier 3 and 2 factors are allocated to the tier 1 factors. Each <a href="#facalloc">allocation</a> involves different <a href="#unit">units</a>. Like <a href="#composed">composed allocations</a>, the aim of allocated-inclusive allocations is to allocate tier 3 factors to tier 2 factors and then to to allocate these factors to tier 1 factors. The difference is that only for <a href="#composed">composed allocations</a> can tier 3 factors be ignored in the second <a href="#facalloc">allocation</a>, where tier 2 factors are allocated to tier 1 factors. Allocated-inclusive multiple allocations form a <A HREF="#chain">chain of allocations</A>. Allocated-inclusive multiple randomizations result when both <A HREF="#facalloc">allocations</A> involve only <A HREF="#randomization">randomization</A>. <a href="MTMulti.html#ainclusive">Diagram</a></p>

<p>(an) <a name="facalloc"><b>allocation</b></a> Involves the allocation of one or more sets of <a href="#object">objects</a> to another set of <a href="#object">objects</a>. In a single allocation one set of <a href="#object">objects</a> is termed the allocated set of <a href="#object">objects</a> and the other set is termed the recipient set of <a href="#object">objects</a>. Each set of <a href="#object">objects</a> is indexed by a set of factors that is referred to as a <a href="#tier">tier</a>. An allocation may involve both <a href="#randomization">randomization</a> and systematic elements; the systematic elements can be viewed as placing further restrictions on the permutations to be used in carrying out the <a href="#randomization">randomization</a> element of the allocation. An outcome of an allocation is that allocated <A HREF="#source">sources</A> are <A HREF="#confound">confounded</A> with certain recipient <A HREF="#source">sources</A> and this can be displayed using a <a href="#decomptable">decomposition table</a></p>
</p>

<p><a name="allocbasedmodel"><b>allocation-based mixed models</b></a> Are models based on the <A HREF="#facalloc">allocations</A> employed in the <A HREF="#expdesign">design</A> for an experiment, and so are obtained after the <A HREF="#expdesign">design</A> is obtained (cf. <A HREF="#antmodel">anticipated model</A>). <a href="MTBibliog.html#Brien17">Brien (2017c, Figure 2)</a> shows the derivation of such a model from the <A HREF="#allocdiagram">factor-allocation diagram</A> using a three-stage process that is analogous to that of <a href="MTBibliog.html#Brien091">Brien and Dem&eacute;trio (2009)</a>. At each stage of this process a particular allocation-based model is obtained: </p>

<OL>
  <LI><A HREF="#initallocmodel">initial allocation model</A>: The model that reflects the <a href="#facalloc">allocations</a> in the experiment. It can be obtained directly from the <A HREF="#allocdiagram">factor-allocation diagram</A> and specified using <A HREF="#intraformulae">intratier formulae</A>.</LI>
  <LI><A HREF="#homogallocmodel">homogeneous allocation model</A>: The model derived from the <A HREF="#initallocmodel">initial allocation model</A> by swapping <A HREF="#term">terms</A> from being fixed to random and vice versa and by adding <A HREF="#term">terms</A>.</LI>
  <LI><A HREF="#priorallocmodel">prior allocation model</A>: The model obtained from the <A HREF="#homogallocmodel">homogeneous allocation model</A> by reparameterizing fixed and random <A HREF="#term">terms</A>, if required, and removing <A HREF="#term">terms</A> to ensure that the variance matrix for the model is nonsingular. The prior allocation model is derived prior to the data being available for analysis; it represents what is considered at that point in time to be the maximal model.</LI>
</OL>

<p>The models are expressed in the form of <A HREF="#symbolmodel">symbolic mixed models</A>, being a list of fixed <A HREF="#term">terms</A> and a list of random <A HREF="#term">terms</A>.  <a href="MTBibliog.html#Brien091">Brien and Dem&eacute;trio (2009)</a> include extra considerations in the model formulation process for longitudinal experiments.</p>

<p><a href="#randbasemodel">Randomization-based mixed models</a> are a restricted class of allocation-based mixed models.</p> 
 
<p><a name="formulae"><b>analysis formulae</b></a> The formulae, one for each <A HREF="#panel">tier</A>, displaying the relationships between the factors within a <A HREF="#panel">tier</A> and incorporating any <A HREF="#intertier">intertier interactions</A>. They are used in <A HREF="MTDTabDescript.html#formulae">Deriving the decomposition table</A> for an experiment.</p>

<p><a name="aovtable"><b>analysis-of-variance table</b></a> A table that includes <a href="#source">Sources</a>, degrees of freedom, sums of squares, mean squares, F statistics and perhaps p-values. Optionally, <A HREF="#ceff">efficiency factors</A> and expected mean squares may be added. The <a href="#source">sources</a> should be genuine <A HREF="#source">sources</A> based on only genuine factors. That is, they are derived from <a href="#skaovtable">skeleton analysis-of-variance tables</a> by adding statistics calculated from observed data, which in turn are derived from <a href="#decomptable">decomposition tables</a>. As for <a href="#decomptable">decomposition tables</a>, we derive them from the <a href="#tier">tiers</a> so that they display the <A HREF="#confound">confounding</A> arising from the <A HREF="#facalloc">allocation</A> employed in the experiment. There is a a <EM>major column</EM> for each <a href="#formulae">analysis formula</a>. 

<p><a name="anatomy"><b>anatomy</b></a> (of a design) The structure built on the foundations provided by the <a href="#facalloc">allocations</a> in an <A HREF="#expdesign">experimental design</A> that is expressed in the <A HREF="#aliasing">aliasing</A> and <A HREF="#confound">confounding</A> relationships between the <A HREF="#source">sources</A> derived from the <A HREF="#term">terms</A> in a <A HREF="#mixedmodel">mixed model</A> for an experiment. It is displayed in an <a href="aovtable">ANOVA-like</a> <A HREF="#tier">tiered</A> <A HREF="#decomptable">decomposition table</A> and is useful for checking the properties of a proposed <A HREF="#expdesign">experimental design</A>.</p>

<p><a name="aovapplicable"><b>anova-applicable experiment</b></a> An experiment that is <A HREF="#sbalance">structure balanced</A> and for which the estimates of the fixed effects for each <A HREF="#source">source</A> are to be obtained from a single <A HREF="#source">source</A>: the combination of information from different <A HREF="#source">sources</A> is not required. Consequently, analyzing the data from the experiment using an analysis of variance is feasible.</p>

<p><a name="antmodel"><b>anticipated model</b> A <A HREF="#mixedmodel">mixed model</A> with <A HREF="#term">terms</A> for the effects that are anticpated to occur in an experiment and are formulated before a design is obtained (cf. <A HREF="#allocbasedmodel">allocation models</A>). It would be formed before a design is chosen and used to inform the selection of a design. Deciding on the <A HREF="#term">terms</A> to include often requires consultation with the researcher. Generally, the objective in looking for a design is to find one that is optimal for this model. However, the anticipated model is often not explicitly stated, but has a subliminal presence, and so the search for an optimal design can be an informal process.</p>

<p><a name="balance"><b>balance</b></a> The relationships between the subspaces of the <A HREF="#source">sources</A> intrinsic to a <A HREF="#expdesign">design</A> described in terms of the <A HREF="#ceff">canonical efficiency factors</A>. Some types of balance are <A HREF="#strorthdesign">structure orthogonal</A>, <A HREF="#orthdesign">orthogonal</A>, <A HREF="#order1">first-order balanced</A>, <A HREF="#sbalance">structure balanced</A> and <A HREF="#unbal">unbalanced</A>. The restrictions placed on the values of the <A HREF="#ceff">canonical efficiency factors</A> deccrease from left to right and it will be said that the <A HREF="#degree">degree of balance</A> concomitantly decreases.  Except for <A HREF="#unbal">unbalanced</A>, each of the types of balance include all types to its left in the list. A <A HREF="#strorthdesign">structure-orthogonal design</A> has only <A HREF="#ceff">canonical efficiency factors</A> whose values are 1 and there is no <A HREF="#aliasing">aliasing</A>; an <A HREF="#orthdesign">orthogonal design</A> relaxes the restrictions of a <A HREF="#strorthdesign">structure-orthogonal design</A> to allow <A HREF="#aliasing">aliasing</A>. A <A HREF="#order1">structure-balanced design</A> has only one value between 0 and 1 for its <A HREF="#ceff">canonical efficiency factors</A> and there is no <A HREF="#aliasing">aliasing</A>; a <A HREF="#order1">first-order, balanced design</A> relaxes the restrictions of a  <A HREF="#sbalance">structure-balanced design</A> to allow <A HREF="#aliasing">aliasing</A>. An <A HREF="#unbal">unbalanced design</A> has at least one pair of <A HREF="#source">sources</A> with multiple values for their <A HREF="#ceff">canonical efficiency factors</A>; that is, the <A HREF="#order">order of balance</A> for the pair of sources is greater than one.

The balance of a design can be investigated using the <CODE>designAnatomy</CODE> function in the <CODE>R</CODE> package <A HREF="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=dae/"><CODE>dae</CODE></A>.</p>

<p><a name="cancompmodel"><b>canonical-components model</b> The random model for a <A HREF="#mixedmodel">mixed model</A> in which all the variance parameters are <A HREF="#cancomp">canonical components</A>. The class of variance matrices for canonical-components models includes those for <A HREF="#varcompmodel">variance-components models</A>)</p>

<p><a name="cancomp"><b>canonical (covariance) component</b> Like a <A HREF="#varcomp">variance component</A> that, except for the component for an <A HREF="#idterm">identity term</A>, is allowed to be negative. Components for <A HREF="#idterm">identity terms</A> must be positive definite to ensure that the variance matrix is positive definite. The component for a <A HREF="#term">term</A> is denoted by &lsquo;&phi;&rsquo; with a subscript that consists of the initial letters of the <A HREF="#tier">tier</A> factors in the <A HREF="#genfactor">generalized factor</A> for the <A HREF="#term">term</A>. A canonical component, except that for an <A HREF="#idterm">identity term</A>, can be interpreted as a component of excess covariance: it measures the difference between the covariance of the responses on the <A HREF="#object">objects</A> in a <A HREF="#tier">tier</A> that have the same level of a particular <A HREF="#genfactor">generalized factor</A> and the combined covariances of all <A HREF="#genfactor">generalized factors</A> marginal to it. (<a href="MTBibliog.html#Bailey16">Bailey and Brien, 2016, Section 2</a>). (cf. <A HREF="#varcomp">variance component</A>)</p>

<p><a name="ceff"><b>canonical efficiency factor</b> Reflects the amount of information shared by two <A HREF="#source">sources</A>. It is a nonzero eigenvalue of a certain product of the projection matrices for the two <A HREF="#source">sources</A> and takes values between zero and one (<a href="MTBibliog.html#Brien092">Brien, C.J., and Bailey, 2009</a>). For an allocated <A HREF="#source">source</A> <A HREF="#confound">confounded</A> with a recipient <A HREF="#source">source</A>, it measures the amount of confounding; a value of one for all canonical efficiency factors means that all the informated about the allocated <A HREF="#source">source</A> is <A HREF="#confound">confounded</A> with the recipient <A HREF="#source">source</A>, while values of less than one for some or all canonical efficiency factors indicates that they are <A HREF="#confound">partially confounded</A>. Simularly, for two <A HREF="#aliasing">aliased</A> <A HREF="#source">sources</A>. The number of nonzero eigenvalues is equal to the degrees of freedom for the combined <A HREF="#source">source</A> that results from combining the two <A HREF="#source">sources</A>. Summary statistics are calculated from canonical efficiency factors to provide <A HREF="#effcriteria">efficiency criteria</A>. The restrictions on the values taken by the canonical efficiency factors for a <A HREF="#expdesign">design</A> are characterised in terms of the <A HREF="#degree">degree of balance</A> that the <A HREF="#expdesign">design</A> exhibits.</p>

<p><a name="chain"><b>chain of allocations</b></a> <A HREF="#facalloc">Allocations</A> in which the <A HREF="#recipfactors">recipient factors/objects</A> for one <A HREF="#facalloc">allocation</A> are allocated to the <A HREF="#recipfactors">receipient factors/objects</A> for another <A HREF="#facalloc">allocation</A>. This contrasts with <A HREF="#twoone">two-one</A> and <A HREF="#onetwo">one-two</A> allocations. <A HREF="#composed">Composed</A> and <A HREF="#ainclusive">allocation-inclusive</A> multiple allocations produce a chain of <A HREF="#facalloc">allocations</A>. <a href="MTMulti.html#composed">Diagram</a></p>

<p><a name="coincident"><b>coincident multiple allocations</b></a> Involves three <A HREF="#tier">tiers</A> of factors. Tier 2 and 3 factors are <A HREF="#facalloc">allocated</A> to the same tier 1 factors in two separate <A HREF="#facalloc">allocations</A>.

Each <A HREF="#facalloc">allocations</A> involves different <a href="#unit">units</a>. Like <a href="#ainclusive">allocated-inclusive allocations</a>, the aim of composed <A HREF="#facalloc">allocations</A> is to allocate tier 3 factors to tier 2 factors and then to allocate these factors to tier 1 factors. The difference is that only for composed allocated can tier 3 factors be ignored in the second <A HREF="#facalloc">allocations</A>, where tier 2 factors are allocated to tier 1 factors.

<p><a name="confound"><b>confounding</b></a> Relates to the relatonship between a <A HREF="#source">source</A> involving <A HREF="#allocfactors">allocated factors</A>, and perhaps some <A HREF="#recipfactors">recipient factors</A> if it is an <A HREF="#intertier">intertier interaction</A>, and a <A HREF="#source">source</A> involving <A HREF="#recipfactors">recipient factors</A> that have received the <A HREF="#allocfactors">allocated factors</A> either directly or indirectly.  There are three possibilities for the  allocated <A HREF="#source">source</A>: (i) it is orthogonal to the recipient <A HREF="#source">source</A>, (ii) it is confounded with the recipient <A HREF="#source">sources</A> in that all the information about it contained in the recipient <A HREF="#source">source</A> (their <A HREF="#ceff">canoncial efficiency factors</A> are all one), or (iii) it is partially confounded because only some of the information about it is obtainable from the recipient <A HREF="#source">sources</A> (at least some of their <A HREF="#ceff">canoncial efficiency factors</A> are less than one). Technically, the subspace for the allocated <A HREF="#source">source</A> is: (i) for orthogonality, orthogonal to the subspace the recipient <A HREF="#source">source</A>,  (ii) for confounded, a subspace of the subspace for the recipient <A HREF="#source">source</A>, or (iii) for partially confounded, nonorthogonal to the subspace for the recipient <A HREF="#source">source</A>. It differs from <A HREF="#exconfound">exhaustive confounding</A> in that it is primarily a property of an allocated <A HREF="#source">source</A>. This meaning of confounding is consistent with the traditional usage of it in the context of confounding of effects with blocks in 2<SUP><EM>k</EM></SUP> and 3<SUP><EM>k</EM></SUP> factorial designs. (cf. <A HREF="#aliasing">alaising</A>)</p>

<p><a name="consonant"><b>consonant randomization</b></a> Occurs when the nesting of the factors being randomized matches the nesting of the factors to which they are randomized. When this is not the case, the randomization is not consonant. For example, a nested factor is to be randomized to a non-nested factor results in a nonconsant randomization. A sign that a randomization may not be consonant is that the number of levels combinations of the factors being randomized is greater than those of the factors to which they are randomized.</a>

<p><a name="grazing"><b>grazing trials</b></a> Grazing trials are experiments that involve animals grazing pasture and/or crops. These experiments are often inherently <a href="#multitiered">multitiered</a> as they involve the <a href="#multiplealloc">multiple randomizations</a> of treatments to plots and the randomization of plots to animals. <a href="MTBibliog.html#Brien98a">Brien, C.J., and Dem&eacute;trio (1998a)</a> discuss the design and analysis of grazing trials from a multitiered perspective.

<p><a name="homogallocmodel"><b>homogeneous allocation model</b></a> The second of three <A HREF="#allocbasedmodel">allocation-based models</A> to produce in formulating the <A HREF="#mixedmodel">mixed model</A> for a designed experiment. Convert the <A HREF="#initallocmodel">initial allocation model</A> to the homogeneous allocation model by (i) adding <A HREF="#intertier">intertier interactions</A> that are of interest to the researcher (e.g. interactions of factors such as Sites, Sex, Judges and so on with Treatments), (ii) augmenting the model with potentially important <A HREF="#term">terms</A> not taken into account in constructing the experimental design (e.g. <A HREF="#source">sources</A> of variation identified during or after the running of the experiment or that could not be incorporated into the design), and (iii) deciding if any <A HREF="#term">terms</A> need to be swapped from fixed to random and vice versa. The model is homogeneous in the sense that all the fixed <A HREF="#term">terms</A> have a parameter for each level of its genearlized factor and the random effects for each <A HREF="#term">term</A> are assumed independently and identically distributed.</p>

<p><a name="idterm"><b>identity term</b></a> A <A HREF="#term">term</A> that <A HREF="#uniqueindex">uniquely indexes</A> a set of <A HREF="#object">objects</A> with as many elements as there are <A HREF="#obsunit">observational units.</A>.

Tier 2 and 3 factors are allocated to different sets of tier 1 factors in two separate <A HREF="#facalloc">allocations</A>.

<p><a name="initallocmodel"><b>initial allocation model</b></a> Is the first of three <A HREF="#allocbasedmodel">allocation-based models</A> to produce in formulating the <A HREF="#mixedmodel">mixed model</A> for a designed experiment. Obtained directly from the <A HREF="#allocdiagram">factor-allocation diagram</A> by forming <A HREF="#term">terms</A> from all posible combinations of the factors within a <A HREF="#panel">panel</A>, subject to the restriction that <A HREF="#term">terms</A> involving a nested factor must include all its nesting factors. The fixed <A HREF="#term">terms</A> are those that come from the factors in a panel that was only ever <A HREF="#allocfactors">allocated</A>; the remaining <A HREF="#term">terms</A> are the random <A HREF="#term">terms</A>. The models can be compressed by using an <A HREF="#intraformulae">intratier formula</A> for the fixed <A HREF="#term">terms</A> and the sum of one or more <A HREF="#intraformulae">intratier formulae</A> for the random <A HREF="#term">terms</A>.

<p>When the set of objects, and their factors, are allocated using only <A HREF="#randomization">randomization</A> that respects the nesting relationships between the factors as exhibited in the <A HREF="#allocdiagram">factor-allocation diagram</A> then the initial allocation model
is designated as the randomization model. When at least one <A HREF="#allocfactors">allocated factor</A> has not been randomized, but the factors to which they are allocated have been taken into account in the
design construction, the initial allocation model is termed a quasi-randomization model. On
the other hand, if not all the factors and their nesting relationships, shown in a <A HREF="#allocdiagram">factor-allocation diagram</A>, were taken into account in the design construction, the initial allocation model is called an assumed model.</LI>

<p><a name="panel"><b>panel</b></a> A box or oval in a <a href="MTFacAlloc.html">factor-alocation diagram</a> that lists the factors in a <a href="#tier">tier</a>, along with their numbers of levels and nesting relations. A factor that is nested is followed by `in' and a list of the first letters of the names of the factors within which it is nested.</p>

<p><a name="phase"><b>phase</b></a> The period of time during which a set of <a href="#unit">units</a> are engaged in producing their outcome. The outcome can be material for processing in the next phase, or values for response variables, or both. Only the final phase need have a response variable. Also, one phase might overlap another phase. 

<p>If the <a href="#unit">units</a> are a random sample, then no <a href="#facalloc">allocation</a> is involved and the study is an observational study.

<p><a name="pseudofac"><b>pseudofactor</b></a> A factor that groups levels of another factor, but does not represent a new <A HREF="#source">source</A> of differences in the experiment. It is usually used as to identify a set of subspaces for a <A HREF="#term">term</A> that will produce a <a href="#sbalance">balanced</a> analysis. They occur more frequently in multitiered than in two-tiered experiments. They were introduced by Yates in connection with balanced lattice square designs. Yates' pseudofactors represent groups of treatments to be applied to rows or columns in a row-column design. His pseudofactors still represent Treatment contrasts -- it is just that recognition of these Treatment groups aids the analysis in that it is balanced with respect to the pseudofactors.

<p>(a) <a name="randomization"><b>randomization</b></a> An <a href="#facalloc">allocation</a> that involves only randomization.

We also refer to the recipient <a href="#object">objects</a> as the unrandomized <a href="#object">objects</a> and the allocated <a href="#object">objects</a> as the randomized <a href="#object">objects</a> for this randomization. A randomization is achieved by allocating, at random, the levels combinations of the allocated <A HREF="#tier">tier</A> of factors to the recipient <A HREF="#tier">tier</A> of factors using the following procedure:</p>

<ol>
<li>for the recipient <a href="#object">objects</a>, write down an unrandomized list of the levels combinations of factors from both <A HREF="#tier">tiers</A> according to the design being used;</li>
<li>identify the set of all permutations of the levels combinations for the factors from the recipient <A HREF="#tier">tier</A> for the design being used --- this set involves restrictions imposed by the design being used;</li>
<li>to randomize the levels 
combinations of factors from the allocated <A HREF="#tier">tier</A>, randomly choose a

<p>(the) <a name="singleset"><b>single-set description</b></a> The smallest set of factors, including the factors of interest to the researcher, that is sufficient to <A HREF="MTGlossary.html#uniqueindex">uniquely index</A> the units in the experiment.

A source represents a difference between a pair of <A HREF="#mixedmodel">mixed models</A>.

<p>(a) <a name="structure"><b>structure</b></a> The set of subspaces or <a href="#source">sources</a> associated with a set of <a href="#object">objects</a>. The set of subspaces consists of a subspace for each <A HREF="#term">term</A> and has a corresponding <a href="#source">source</a> in the <a href="#decomptable">decomposition table</a>.

In standard textbook designs, where there is only one <a href="#facalloc">allocation</a>, 
the factors in the two tiers are often referred to as the unit (or block) factors and the treatment factors, the unit factors being the <A HREF="#recipfactors">recipient factors</A> and the treatment factors being the <A HREF="#allocfactors">allocated factors</A>. However, just two names, like 'unit' and 'treatment', are inadequate for experiments involving more than two tiers.

First described by <a href="MTBibliog.html#McIntyre55">McIntyre (1955)</a> and discussed by <a href="MTBibliog.html#Cox58">Cox (1958, Section 5.5)</a>, although Cox used the term &lsquo;stage&rsquo; rather than &lsquo;<a href="#phase">phase</a>&rsquo;.</p>

<p>That is, they are experiments in which a) two separate time periods are involved and b) the <a href="#unit">units</a> on which the experiment is conducted in the second <a href="#phase">phase</a> are completely different to those in the first <a href="#phase">phase</a>. They are usually <a href="#multitiered">multitiered</a> because they generally employ <a href="#multiplealloc">multiple allocations</a>, at least one in each <A HREF="#phase">phase</A>; two-phase experiments that employ an observational-study design in the first <a href="#phase">phase</a> may not be <A HREF="#multitiered">multitiered</A>. A very common type of two-phase experiment is one that involves <a href="MTMphase.html#labphase">a field phase and a laboratory phase</a>. In the field <a href="#phase">phase</a>, a field trial is carried out on field <a href="#unit">units</a> and then the produce from that experiment is taken in to the laboratory where the experiment involves laboratory <a href="#unit">units</a>. Other <a href="MTGlossary.html#source">sources</a> of two-phase experiments include (i) experiments that involve a <a href="#storage">storage phase</a> for the second <a href="#phase">phase</a> (ii) greenhouse experiments that involve two greenouse <a href="#phase">phases</a>, the plants being moved from one room/greenhouse in the first <a href="#phase">phase</a> to another room/greenouse in the next <a href="#phase">phase</a>, and (iii) experiments that involve multiple <A HREF="#phase">phases</A> in the laboratory, such as some gene-expression and plant pathology experiments. (For a review of where multiphase experiments have been applied see <a href="MTBibliog.html#Brien17">Brien, 2017c</a>.)</p>

<p>A subset of these are the <a href="#normal2phase">normal two-phase experiments</a>.</p>

<p>More generally, experiments can be <a href="#multiphase">multiphase</a>.</p>

<p><a name="unbal"><b>unbalanced designs</b> Those that do not meet the conditions for <A HREF="#sbalance">structure balance</A>.</p>

<p><a name="uniqueindex"><b>unique indexing</b></a> The indexing of a set of <a href="#object">objects</a> by a set of factors in which each <a href="#object">object</a> has a unique combination of the levels of the factors.</p>

<p><a name="unit"><b>units</b></a> (for an experimental design) Form a set of <a href="#object">objects</a>, the recipient objects, to which one or more other sets of <a href="#object">objects</a> is allocated. For a standard design only one set of <a href="#object">objects</a>, called the <a href="#treatment">treatments</a>, are allocated to the one set of <A HREF="#recipfactors">recipient objects</A>, called the units. For other designs, one or more sets of <a href="#treatment">treatments</a> or of units may be assigned. The units for an observational study design are the selected <a href="#object">objects</a>. <a href="#obsunit">Observational units</a> are the units that are never allocated.</p>

<p><a name="uinclusive"><b>unrandomized-inclusive multiple randomizations</b></a> (deprecated) <A HREF="#rinclusive">Recipient-inclusive multiple allocations</A> that only involve randomization. Now referring to them as recipient-inclusive multiple randomizations would be more appropriate. <a href="MTMulti.html#rinclusive">Diagram</a>.</p>

<p><a name="varcomp"><b>variance component</b> The variance contributed to the observations by a <A HREF="#term">term</A> in the <A HREF="#mixedmodel">mixed model</A> for an experiment. It is constrained to be nonnegative and is often  viewed as the variance of a set of random effects associated with a <A HREF="#term">term</A> in the <A HREF="#mixedmodel">mixed model</A>. The component for a <A HREF="#term">term</A> is denoted by &lsquo;&sigma;<SUP>2</SUP>&rsquo; with a subscript that consists of the initial letters of the <A HREF="#tier">tier</A> factors in the <A HREF="#genfactor">generalized factor</A> for the <A HREF="#term">term</A>.(cf. <A HREF="#cancomp">canonical component</A>)</p>

<p><a name="varcompmodel"><b>variance-components model</b> The random model for a <A HREF="#mixedmodel">mixed model</A> in which all the variance parameters are <A HREF="#varcomp">variance components</A>. The class of variance matrices for variance-components models is a subset of those for <A HREF="#varcompmodel">canonical-components models</A>)</p>
